# About me

## Bio

I grew up in Sydney, where I went to [Middle Harbour Public School][middle harbour], [Neutral Bay
Public School][neutral bay] and [North Sydney Boys High School][nsbhs]. In 1969 my family spent a
year in Tübingen and London, and in 1975-76 a year in New Haven. I was in the school orchestra and
choir. I took part in several school musical coproductions with North Sydney Girls High, including
playing the role of Frederick in the Pirates of Penzance in 1979. I was in the school debating team
that won the state-wide Hume Barbour competition in 1980.

I studied pure mathematics and computer science at the [Australian National University][anu] (ANU).
My doctorate was in [applied mathematics][anu applied maths] at the ANU, modelling the geometry of
self-assembled microstructure in surfactant systems. I was based at the ANU but also spent time in
Paris and Lund. I had postdoctoral fellowships in Bordeaux and ANU, and lectured in mathematics at
Sydney and Macquarie.

In 1998 I changed fields to computer science and software engineering. I had a tenured lectureship
in [computer science at ANU][anu dcs]. After moving to Scotland in 2010, I was leader of the
[computing degree][uhi computing degree] at the University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland.

In 2003-4 I studied creative writing at the University of Canberra. In 2006-7 I trained as a
psychotherapist and counsellor at the Jansen-Newman Institute in Sydney. I practised psychotherapy
part-time in Canberra until the end of 2009.

In 2017 I left academia. I worked at [Quintessence Labs][qlabs] in Canberra and then at
[Cryptosense][cryptosense] in Paris. In 2022 Cryptosense was acquired by [SandboxAQ][sandbox], a
Google X (“the moonshot factory”) spinout.

In November 2023 I returned to Scotland, where I now live in the Findhorn eco-village intentional
community.

## Interests

I like bushwalking / hiking / randonnée, whether in mountains, forests or along coastlines. I have
done a few walks of a week or so: the Great Glen Way in Scotland, Djebel Siroua in Morocco, around
the Kaisergebirge in Austria, the Corfu trail. I'm interested in doing a longer walk some time,
maybe the Camino.
