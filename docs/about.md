# About me

![Mugshot](assets/2024-01-19-blue-check-shirt.jpg){ width=25% }

I grew up in Sydney, studied pure mathematics and computer science at the
Australian National University (ANU), finishing with a doctorate in applied
mathematics / soft-matter physics.

I had a 25 year academic career with the CNRS in France, Sydney and Macquarie
universities, ANU and finally the University of the Highlands and Islands in
Scotland, where I was leader of the computing degree.

I also studied creative writing, and later trained as a psychotherapist and
counsellor. I practiced psychotherapy part-time for three years.

In 2017 I left academia and have worked since then as a software engineer
specialising in cryptography.

I live in the Findhorn eco-village / intentional community in the north of
Scotland.

My interests include walking in nature, choral singing, playing the piano,
reading as widely as possible, experimenting with visual art, philosophy &
politics, psychotherapy, trauma & recovery, sexual politics, men's work...
