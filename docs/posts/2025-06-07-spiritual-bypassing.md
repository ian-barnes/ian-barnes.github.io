# Spiritual bypassing

_The only way out is through._

_You can't put the genie back in the bottle._

<!-- more -->

In [_Transformation_][transformation], Robert A. Johnson talks about two-, three- and
four-dimensional man. I think this—if brought up-to-date, translating “man" into
person etc.—this can be quite a useful concept. Illuminating some of the more
frustrating aspects of my current experience.

Two-dimensional man is primitive, simple, naïve. And happy. There are very few
two-dimensional men (people) in the world now. Peter Sellers' character Chance
the gardener in _Being There_. Some members of traditional cultures with very
little contact with the outside world.

Three-dimensional man has knowledge, he thinks, he has science and philosophy
and politics and culture. And he is anxious and unhappy, disconnected from
nature and from himself, from his instinct, his sex, and his power. Almost all
of us live in this world.

Four-dimensional man is... enlightened, holding all the complexity and subtlety
of the modern world, but unburdened. Able to live simply, happily. The path
there is long and difficult, painful. Self-actualisation, spiritual growth,
self-knowledge, transcendence.

None of us is happy in the three-dimensional world. We all want a way out. We
crave the simplicity, the happiness, the sense of oneness with nature, the
fulfilment, the honesty, the open-heartedness.

Many seek to go back to the two-dimensional. Back to nature, embracing
traditional cultures, dancing, ceremonies. Renouncing the modern world. Getting
caught up in cults and conspiracies. Rejecting "consensus reality". Railing
against technology while glued to their mobile phones. Denouncing mainstream
medicine while walking around with bionic hips and knees. Even Thoreau, as deep
and interesting as his experiment was, even he was trying to escape the world,
to forget what he knew, to live like a primitive in a world that wasn't any
more.

This is spiritual bypassing, this seeking to go back to the two-dimensional
world. But the myths are right. You can't put the genie back in the bottle. Once
you've opened Pandora's box, you can't put everything back in and close it
again. Once you've tasted the fruit, you're forever cast out of the garden.

The only way out is through. Therapy, deep group work, maybe psychedelics. Parts
work in therapy, that started with inner child work, but is now sometimes called
internal family systems. Bring all the parts together. Unify them. Reject
nothing. Have the strength, the subtlety, the empathy, the wisdom to hold the
contradictions, to encompass them. And the same in the outside world

Maybe Descartes set this all back a few hundred years with mind-body duality. By
living in our heads, ignoring and neglecting our bodies, we've developed
technology with no soul. Cold. Functional. And look where that's gotten us: a
planet in conflict, on the verge of destruction, war among humans second only to
our war against nature. A population explosion, pollution, inequality,
suffering, imbalance, destruction...

But I'm convinced, more and more, that this isn't an either-or situation. It's
not about head vs heart & body. We need both. Working together. The dialectic of
the ancient Greeks: thesis, antithesis, synthesis. Here the thesis is
two-dimensional man: nature, body, heart, simplicity. The antithesis is
three-dimensional man: science, technology, split off from nature, anxiety and
dissociation. And the synthesis we're looking for is four-dimensional man: head,
heart and body working together, in harmony internally, and with nature, and
with each other.

I was away last weekend at the first seminar of the 18-month Living Tantra
training with Jan Day and Frieder Fischer. I had two profound experiences in the
morning meditations.

On the second morning, during the quiet part of the meditation, my thoughts
drifted off into thinking about one of my current fascinations, the arrangement
of the scales in a pine cone, how the Fibonacci numbers emerge almost magically
from simple growth rules... And then I realised I'd drifted off into thinking
and started to beat myself up about being bad at meditation, too easily
distracted, wasting my time... And _then_ I had a moment, a revelation. This
"thinking" came from my free child, that sense of wonder, curiosity, excitement.
He's reminding me he's here, and demanding not to be forgotten, left behind.
This aspect of my inner child definitely lives in my head, in thoughts,
theories, mathematics, science... but he's also in my body and my heart, in that
sense of wonder, of fascination. For my own personal journey, I absolutely need
to bring that part along.

And more generally, it's not thinking that's the problem, it's thinking divorced
from feeling. It's the economist whose theories only consider money, divorced
from the human and natural context. It's the pursuit of short-term profit.

On the final morning, during the progression upward through the chakras, when we
reached the eyebrow centre, the third eye, the guiding words talked about
connecting with the world, nature and other people, sending my light out
and receiving the world's, the universe's energy back in. And I suddenly had a
crystal clear vision of a world in harmony. People living in small settlements
surrounded by, interwoven with nature, interconnected. I saw our planet turning,
orbiting the sun, the stars and other planets and galaxies... and I saw a
village and nearby a clearing in the forest, and a huge oak tree, and under it a
naked woman with long brown hair dancing. And I looked into her eyes and I saw
the galaxies again, the entire universe. In harmony.
