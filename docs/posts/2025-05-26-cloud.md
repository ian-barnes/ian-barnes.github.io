# Cloud

Lying on my back  
Stretching my glutes  
Looking out the upside-down window  
Leaves, wind, smears on the glass...

<!-- more -->

A cloud  
Lit up bright by the sun passing through  
Glowing delicate rainbow colours  
Lavender, eggshell blue, peach...  
Like a pearl, or a paua shell.

My brain starts speculating about angles, refraction  
While the colours make my heart sing  
Tears in my eyes.  
How to explain how exquisite it is  
To hold both?

And again that familiar stab in my heart  
I am alone  
There is nobody here to share all this with  
The beauty I see around me  
The beauty inside me

And when I try,  
The _recoil_  
The good, kind, evolved people, all fixed  
Who can't see past my need, my pain, my brokenness  
Who can't see, or won't see, or just  
Pass over the beauty  
Looking for someone simple and uncomplicated  
Someone who's already done the work  
Like them.
