_Findhorn beach, Sunday 9th February 2025_

Today you said you needed space.  
On the beach I am alone in the fog  
Lost in my fear and doubt.  
There is no future, only _this_ moment, _here, now._  
Flat and grey. Sand, water, muffled sounds.  
I can't feel you, panic lurks in my throat.  
_Breathe_  
Look closer: Pebbles, seaweed, broken shells. Relics.  
The empty echoing wreckage of a love abandoned, half-built.

And then two oystercatchers, paired for life  
Working the water's edge  
Alongside me, for a little while.  
Long enough.

I am connected with life  
I am alive  
I am love  
Yes
