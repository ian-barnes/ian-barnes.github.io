This is a follow-up to [Visualisation of periodic
surfaces]({% link _posts/2020-12-20-visualisation-of-periodic-surfaces.md %}). A while ago
I saw this 3D printed Gyroid model advertised online and couldn't resist it. Design by
[Bathsheba Grossman](https://www.bathsheba.com/), printed on demand by
[Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/product/QNFAKNW9Z/gyroid).

It's been sitting on my desk for two years. A few days ago I somewhat randomly made an
origami cube and it turned out to be almost exactly the same size. They were sitting on my
desk and the sun came in through the window and hit them, so I took this photo.
