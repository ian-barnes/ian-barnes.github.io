Bio
---

I was born in 1963 in Sydney, Australia, where I went to Middle Harbour Public
School, Neutral Bay Public School and North Sydney Boys High School. In 1969 my
family spent a year in Tübingen and London, and in 1975-76 a year in New Haven.

I studied pure mathematics and computer science at the Australian National
University. My doctorate was in applied mathematics, modelling the geometry of
self-assembled microstructure in surfactant systems. I was based at the ANU but
also spent time in Paris and Lund. I had postdoctoral fellowships in Bordeaux
and ANU, and taught mathematics at Sydney and Macquarie. In 1998 I changed
fields to computer science and taught at the ANU for almost ten years.

In 2003-4 I studied creative writing at the University of Canberra. In 2006-7 I
trained as a psychotherapist and counsellor at the Jansen-Newman Institute in
Sydney. I practiced counselling part-time in Canberra until the end of 2009.

In 2010 I moved to the north of Scotland and lived there for 7 years. During
that time I taught computing at the University of the Highlands and Islands.

Since August 2018 I have lived in France, near Paris.

From January 2017 to August 2018 I worked at [Quintessence Labs][qlabs] in
Canberra, on the team developing their key management software. I was
particularly involved with public key infrastructure and also assisted in
troubleshooting customer support issues.

From August 2010 until January 2017 I was a lecturer in computing at [Moray
College][MC], part of the [University of the Highlands and Islands][UHI]. I
taught mostly programming and software-related courses, at all levels from
Further Education (Level 6 in the Scottish system) to honours (Level 10). I was
the Programme Leader for the [UHI BSc (Hons) Computing degree][degree]. I was
involved in research in computing education.

Before 2010 I was (in reverse order) a reseach analyst at the [Australian
National Data Service][ANDS], a lecturer in [computer science][CECS] at the
[Australian National University][ANU], a lecturer in [mathematics][MUMaths] at
[Macquarie University][MU], a postdoctoral researcher in [applied
mathematics][applied maths] at [ANU][], a lecturer in [mathematics][USydMaths]
at the [University of Sydney][USyd], a postdoc at the [CNRS][] [Centre de
Recherche Paul Pascal][CRPP] in Bordeaux, a PhD student in applied mathematics
at ANU and an undergraduate student in mathematics and computer science at ANU.

Interests
---------

- bushwalking / walking / hiking / randonnée, whether in mountains, forests or
  along coastlines. I have done a few walks of a week or so: the Great Glen Way
  in Scotland, to Djebel Siroua in the Ante-Atlas mountains in Morocco, and
  around the Kaisergebirge in Austria.

- music: choral singing, in particular of the baroque period, English and
  French madrigals etc., also playing the piano: Bach, Beethoven, Schubert,
  Mozart...

- Australian literature, particularly Helen Garner, Tim Winton, Richard
  Flanagan...
