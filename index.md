## Bio

I grew up in Sydney, where I went to Middle Harbour Public School, Neutral Bay Public
School and North Sydney Boys High School. In 1969 we spent a year in Tübingen and London,
and in 1975-76 a year in New Haven. I was in the school orchestra and choir. I took part
in several school musical coproductions with North Sydney Girls High, including playing
the role of Frederick in the Pirates of Penzance in 1979. I was in the school debating
team that won the state-wide Hume Barbour competition in 1980.

I studied pure mathematics and computer science at the Australian National University. My
doctorate was in applied mathematics, modelling the geometry of self-assembled
microstructure in surfactant systems. I was based at the ANU but also spent time in Paris
and Lund. I had postdoctoral fellowships in Bordeaux and ANU, and lectured in mathematics
at Sydney and Macquarie. In 1998 I changed fields to computer science and taught at the
ANU for almost ten years.

In 2003-4 I studied creative writing at the University of Canberra. In 2006-7 I trained as
a psychotherapist and counsellor at the Jansen-Newman Institute in Sydney. I practised
psychotherapy part-time in Canberra until the end of 2009.

I lived in the north of Scotland for 7 years from 2010, during which time I taught
computing at the University of the Highlands and Islands. I lived in France, near Paris
for 5 years from 2018 to 2023. I returned to Scotland in November 2023.

## Work

I did a PhD in [applied mathematics][anu applied maths] at the Australian National
University (ANU), had postdocs with the [CNRS in Bordeaux][cnrs crpp] and at ANU, and
teaching positions at the [University of Sydney][sydney uni maths] and [Macquarie
University][macquarie uni maths].

In 1998 I changed fields. I had a tenured lectureship in [computer science at
ANU][anu dcs] and was later leader of the [computing degree][uhi computing degree] at the
University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland.

In 2017 I left academia and worked at [Quintessence Labs][qlabs] in Canberra and then at
[Cryptosense][cryptosense] in Paris. In 2022 Cryptosense was acquired by
[SandboxAQ][sandbox], a Google X ("the moonshot factory") spinout.

## Interests

- Bushwalking / walking / hiking / randonnée, whether in mountains, forests or along
  coastlines. I have done a few walks of a week or so: the Great Glen Way in Scotland,
  Djebel Siroua in Morocco, around the Kaisergebirge in Austria, the Corfu trail.
  Interested in a longer walk some time, maybe the Camino.
